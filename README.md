This is a working Node JS server I built for a budget submission application.

Features: 

IP based login authentication,
Login token,
Data shown based on user ID,
Sequential processing despite multiple requests (though Node is Async, MySQL is sequential),
Full error logging, Easy non technical editting of new clients
