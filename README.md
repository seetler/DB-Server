This is a working Node JS server I built for a proposed budget submission application. 

Features: 

IP based login authentication,
Login token,
Data shown based on user ID,
Sequential processing despite multiple requests (though Node is Async, MySQL is sequential),
Full error logging, Easy non technical editting of new clients, 
email confirm,
server auto break-reboot, when you use the arrow key it selects the box in the next direction  (most difficult feature ever), it looks really pretty.
